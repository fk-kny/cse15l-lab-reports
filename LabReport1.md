**command with no arguments**

The command *$ cd* was used and no output was given. No error message was given. The working directory was */home*. There was no output because the command *cd* changes the working directory. Therefore, a path to a directory must be provided to change to. with no valid argument, the working directory remains the same.

**command with a path to a directory as an argument**

The command *$ cd lecture1* was used to change the working directory from */home* to */home/lecture1*. There was no output but we can see from the next line *[user@sahara ~/lecture1]* that the working directory was properly changed.

**command with a path to a file as an argument**

2. ls
3. cat
